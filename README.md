# Awesome GitHub Actions

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of GitHub Actions workflows examples. 
It provides a variety of workflow configurations that demonstrate different use cases and 
best practices for automating CI/CD processes using GitHub Actions. Each 
example includes a name for the workflow, a list of trigger events, and a set of jobs. Each 
job contains a list of steps that execute in order when the job runs. These steps may access
 environment variables, conditions, expressions, and secrets to perform various actions, 
 such as checking out the source repository, running scripts, and setting up a tmate session
 for debugging purposes. Examples cover different areas of functionality, such as job 
 matrix, parallel jobs, job ordering, context variables, expression evaluation, outputting 
 variables, and event triggers.
